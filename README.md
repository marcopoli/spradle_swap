# Description
Fork of the original code: https://github.com/allanj/pytorch_neural_crf <br>
Few changes made for using it for the [SpRadIE @ CLEF eHealth competition](https://sites.google.com/view/spradie-2020)

The code has been used for performing NER operations on a dataset of medical records. Many configuration using BERT, RoBERTA, ELECTRA have been evaluated.

All the details are reported in the following [paper](shorturl.at/ahowK).
